                                Kitchen Sync is a Web application that aims to be a personalized assistant to help people, who are
                                traditionally not inclined to cook for themselves, or people with little to no experience,
                                approach this healthy and cost effective practice without any of the usual stress or
                                problems associated with cooking. How does it manage to do this? Kitchen
                                Sync is the cooking app that adapts to the user instead of forcing the user to adapt to it.</p>
