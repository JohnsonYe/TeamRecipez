                What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
                He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
                He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now
                The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow!

                Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked
                He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No
                He won't have it, he knows his whole back city's ropes
                It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that, but he's broke
